        Stephen Hawking, an award-winning physicist and influential author, died early Wednesday morning, a family
        spokesman told ABC News. He was 76.
        Hawking, whose books included "A Brief History of Time" and "The Universe in a Nutshell," was diagnosed in 1963
        with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, more commonly called ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.
        The family did not disclose the cause of death, but said he “died peacefully” at his home in Cambridge, England.

        "We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary
        man whose work and legacy will live on for many years," the family said in a statement. "His courage and
        persistence with his brilliance and humor inspired people across the world. He once said, 'It would not be much
        of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever."
